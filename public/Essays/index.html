        <h2><u>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</u></h2>

        <p>
            <b>HTML</b> (Hypertext Markup Language) creates a website's structure. HTML requires specific tags in order to opperate. There are different tags that will perform different things, such as dividing something into a class, which helps the code understand how your build works. It can even be used to tag text files to create colors and graphics for web pages. Imagine it as a framework where you're able to construt the basic skeleton of a website through its code.
        </p> 

        <p>
            <b>CSS</b>, or Cascading Stylesheets, let you syle a website. Essentially it lets you make a website look more presentable by providing specifics (where things are laid out, color, typeography, and overall look). It can do things like creating visual effects for your webpage or create simple animations. This website, similar to HTML, is static (which means that it can't be changed after a website is loaded) and all code needs to be inputed beforehand.
        </p>

        <p><b>JavaScript</b> gives the user the opportunity to interact and change their CSS or HTML code while on the page. It allows for interactions to take place on the website, such as pressing a button and having a menu appear as a result or creating keyboard shortcuts for websites. Javascript allows you to make a website interactive and reactive to cut through the static languages of HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript, a website would be unable to respond to user inputs.
        </p>
        <p>All three of these are considered to be languages, but HTML and CSS are different because they are static languages. This means that assests that are put into their code are set before you run your program - they provide a build in and "static" effect on your page or app. CSS provides more of the flair to a website however, as mentioned prior, which is the main component that sets it apart from HTML's framework it provides. JavaScript differs because it is not static, and depends on the interactions it makes with HTML and CSS as well as the user. JavaScript is what makes an app or a website able to alter content. It interacts with CSS and HTML, making it possible for different actions to take place while using a website or app.</p>
        
        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>

        <p>
            A Single Page Application (or SPA) is an app or website that responds to the user by rewriting its code on the current web page with new data from the web server, as opposed to the browser loading entire new pages. A SPA’s goal is to allow for faster transitions when interacting with the page, and makes it feel more like a native app than a web page (a native app being a program that is meant to be used on a specific operating system or device). All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code can be retrieved by the browser with one page load, or the appropriate resources are loaded and added to the page based on user interaction. This gives an SPA a more dynamic feel since it’s responding to the user directly by offering exactly what is needed for the interaction rather than using unnecessary resources by re-downloading the same elements. SPAs are great for developing dynamic platforms that have a small amount of data and can be a great base for making mobile apps. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A MPA (or Multiple Page Application) has a bit more of a traditional make up. Every page in a MPA sends a request to the serve and updates all the data. However, this is true even if there is a small amount of data being used, thus sacrificing performance. Most MPAs act this way out of necessity because they are more complex sites with multiple pages and include many levels with various links. Since they don’t have any page limitations, they can include as much product info as required. These apps have a faster initial page load and are a little more effective for users that need a visual map of where to go with clear navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where the two apps differ is in what someone plans on doing with them. Single page apps are typically used for developing mobile apps due to their readily made code and their speed. They tend to load quicker and are easier to use for both the user and the developer, especially since their front end and back end contents can be separated. This means that developers don’t need to have a server application running, making interacting with the app easier on both sides. MPAs are typically used when designing a website since they have multiple pages and URLs that must load whenever a user clicks a new button. While this does mean slower loading times than a SPA, a MPA makes up for it with its enhanced security, lower costs, and its Search Engine Optimization (SEO) opportunities. A more advanced SEO leads to more potential hits since there are so many potentials for URLs for the search engine to index, and enhanced security is the result of MPA requests being handled by the server since it is being reloaded every time a button is pressed. Yet MPAs are far more complicated to work with and are much more time ineffective during development. They also can provide complications when interacting with mobile devices and are not optimized as SPAs are in this instance. An easier way to think of the difference between the two: SPAs are more optimized for mobile performance, and MPAs are more optimized for web performance.
