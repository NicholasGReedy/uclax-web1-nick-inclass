        <h2><u><b>Q1.</b> Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</u></h2>

        <p>
            <b>HTML</b> (Hypertext Markup Language) creates a website's structure. HTML requires specific tags in order to opperate. There are different tags that will perform different things, such as dividing something into a class, which helps the code understand how your build works. It can even be used to tag text files to create colors and graphics for web pages. Imagine it as a framework where you're able to construt the basic skeleton of a website through its code.
        </p> 

        <p>
            <b>CSS</b>, or Cascading Stylesheets, let you syle a website. Essentially it lets you make a website look more presentable by providing specifics (where things are laid out, color, typeography, and overall look). It can do things like creating visual effects for your webpage or create simple animations. This website, similar to HTML, is static (which means that it can't be changed after a website is loaded) and all code needs to be inputed beforehand.
        </p>

        <p><b>JavaScript</b> gives the user the opportunity to interact and change their CSS or HTML code while on the page. It allows for interactions to take place on the website, such as pressing a button and having a menu appear as a result or creating keyboard shortcuts for websites. Javascript allows you to make a website interactive and reactive to cut through the static languages of HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript, a website would be unable to respond to user inputs.
        </p>
        <p>All three of these are considered to be languages, but HTML and CSS are different because they are static languages. This means that assests that are put into their code are set before you run your program - they provide a build in and "static" effect on your page or app. CSS provides more of the flair to a website however, as mentioned prior, which is the main component that sets it apart from HTML's framework it provides. JavaScript differs because it is not static, and depends on the interactions it makes with HTML and CSS as well as the user. JavaScript is what makes an app or a website able to alter content. It interacts with CSS and HTML, making it possible for different actions to take place while using a website or app.</p>
        
        <h2><u><b>Q2.</b>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</u></h2>

        <p>
            A Single Page Application (or SPA) is an app or website that responds to the user by rewriting its code on the current web page with new data from the web server, as opposed to the browser loading entire new pages. A SPA’s goal is to allow for faster transitions when interacting with the page, and makes it feel more like a native app than a web page (a native app being a program that is meant to be used on a specific operating system or device). All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code can be retrieved by the browser with one page load, or the appropriate resources are loaded and added to the page based on user interaction. This gives an SPA a more dynamic feel since it’s responding to the user directly by offering exactly what is needed for the interaction rather than using unnecessary resources by re-downloading the same elements. SPAs are great for developing dynamic platforms that have a small amount of data and can be a great base for making mobile apps. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A MPA (or Multiple Page Application) has a bit more of a traditional make up. Every page in a MPA sends a request to the serve and updates all the data. However, this is true even if there is a small amount of data being used, thus sacrificing performance. Most MPAs act this way out of necessity because they are more complex sites with multiple pages and include many levels with various links. Since they don’t have any page limitations, they can include as much product info as required. These apps have a faster initial page load and are a little more effective for users that need a visual map of where to go with clear navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where the two apps differ is in what someone plans on doing with them. Single page apps are typically used for developing mobile apps due to their readily made code and their speed. They tend to load quicker and are easier to use for both the user and the developer, especially since their front end and back end contents can be separated. This means that developers don’t need to have a server application running, making interacting with the app easier on both sides. MPAs are typically used when designing a website since they have multiple pages and URLs that must load whenever a user clicks a new button. While this does mean slower loading times than a SPA, a MPA makes up for it with its enhanced security, lower costs, and its Search Engine Optimization (SEO) opportunities. A more advanced SEO leads to more potential hits since there are so many potentials for URLs for the search engine to index, and enhanced security is the result of MPA requests being handled by the server since it is being reloaded every time a button is pressed. Yet MPAs are far more complicated to work with and are much more time ineffective during development. They also can provide complications when interacting with mobile devices and are not optimized as SPAs are in this instance. An easier way to think of the difference between the two: SPAs are more optimized for mobile performance, and MPAs are more optimized for web performance.

        <h3><u><b>Q3.</b>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer, and Back End Developer?</u></h3>
        <p>
        <b>Web designers</b> typically help with graphics and graphic design software, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign) to create the product’s look. A designer’s work is very much creative in nature, bringing to life the product with a certain style. While some web designers may be asked to step into the shoes of a Front End Developer, they are usually just in charge of the creative elements. Putting everything into the right place and making the site appealing to the user comes first, which is accomplished creating “high fidelity diagrams.” These diagrams encapsule the entire look of the page, from typography to color combination to brand design.
            </p>
<p>

<b>A Front-End Developer</b> produces all the code that is used on the front end of the website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) which is to say the code the user can see and interact with directly. This can also be referred to as the “client-side” of development, where Front End Developers oversee everything the users see in their browser or app. While this seems to be similar to a web designer in so far that Front End Designers deal with a product’s look, the difference here is FEDs use code to create a certain style while designers utilize creative apps or programs. They are responsible for making the products responsive and that the content is “fixed,” which means that large pieces of new data aren’t constantly being uploaded. They want to make a site that is easy to navigate for client and user alike through interactive features and written code.
</p>
<p>

<b>A Back End Developer</b> works on the serve side of an app or website and oversees everything communicated between the database and the browser. This means that Back End Developers are responsible for the code that links database information and the browser. They are responsible for server work, ensuring that their code allows the app or site to run smoothly and effectively. Back End programing languages differ from Front End, and include Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and .Net. These individuals are most concerned about a site’s responsiveness and speed, and are not as concerned about the overall style of the site. They create dynamic sites, which are different than the static sites of Front End Developers, which are products that store database information. Where a static site would not constantly upload new info, dynamic sites are constantly changing and updating such as Google Maps or Twitter.
</p>

<h3><u><b>Q4.</b> What is the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths? </u></h3>

<p>
    To understand the difference between site relative, document relative, and absolute paths, we need to understand what the difference between absolute and relative paths are. Paths are directions of sorts that lead to to specific places in a URL or directory, with relative and absolute paths leading you to different locations. Relative paths are URLs that contain only a portion of a full path, and its location is based on the URLs relation to the directory its leading to. This is typically used for convienience sake, since they require less typing and fewer characters. Relative paths also need to be combined with other paths in order to access a file so that a location can be specified. <b> Document Relative </b> paths refer to where documents exist within the directories, and are useful for shared indexes on networks when a physical drive use different letters to represent different users. To set these up, one can specify the path by omitting the part of the absolute URL that the documents share (for example, if the two share "C://User/MyStuff..." then you can link the tail end of that directory so that the files have a more consistent path to take). The same is true for <b> Site Relative </b> paths, which are linked together using the root of the site. For these, the paths can share the same URL (such as www.mysite.com/server and www.mysite.com/community) but can still be linked together using the root of the URL. These typically start with a forward slash (/). This way your paths are more conscise and take up less characters, which is more convienient for developers.
</p>
<p>
        <b> Absolute Paths </b> usually start with the domain URL and are not relient on combining directory roots. It always containts the root element and the complete directory list so that the file can be located. It contains all of the necessary information to locate the file, making it pretty accurate but a tad inconvienient. This can result in slower page load times since you have not told the server the your linked page is located on the same site, forcing your browser to sift through more information to find the directory. It can also be chellenging when wanting to switch domain names since it is hard coded into the site through an absolute path. However, it is much more precise than relative paths because it provides the exact location of a file in your code rather than a shortcut to said file.

<h3><u><b>Final Project Description</b></u></h3>
    <p>
    For my final protect I wanted to do a simple redesign of the bungie.net homepage. Bungie is a video game company in charge of making games such as Halo and Destiny, known as “first person shooter” games. This video game company is widely popular, fostering a community of players that are involved in the growth of the site through forums and through the game itself. After browsing their site I felt as if there were a lot of components we have replicated in class, and that the pages themselves didn’t seem too involved. Features include a store page and a log in page but also include other features we have not touched on in our example website (such as the news or community sections).
    </p>
<p>
I chose this website because of the path I’m traveling in my UCLA extension coursework. I’m enrolled in the UX branch of the program and want to take that knowledge into the field of User Experience Research, working with game developers specifically. Bungie.net is a site very near and dear to me since I used to spend a lot of time on it when I was younger and have had the opportunity to watch it blossom into what it is today. While there are a few features that I still need to figure out how to implement I think the site provides a welcoming challenge, an opportunity to scale it back to include easy to navigate essentials tabs similar to our in class example. I’m unsure if I’m getting in too far over my head and have some back up ideas should this no work out, but I see this opportunity as relevant experience in the industry I want to work in.

<h2>What does it mean for a company to be Agile? What is the purpose of using Agile, and what are its pros and cons?</h2>
<p>An <b> Agile </b> company is a company that is able to quilckly adapt to market changes. These companies need to have several qualities in order to be agile; they must be fast moving and flexible, respond rapidly to unexpected obstacles, be a leader for change, be in touch with customers, and continue to have competitive advantage over others. Being agile promotes adaptive planning and the continuous delivery of software demanded by the market. There are a few branches that come together under the term Agile (such as Kanban, Scrum, and Extreme Programing), which allow a company to respond to changing requirements and customer unpredictability. Despite having multiple methods, Agile holds four values that each method agrees on: Individuals and Interactions, working softwar, customer collaboration, and the ability to respond to change. These all coincide with the five steps projects in agile go through while they're being developed: Define, design, build, test, and release.
</p>
<p>
    Agile allows companies to produce incremental, iterative, and demonstrable software solutions. It's an essential piece of development in order to stay on top of market demands, and has been used more and more frequently as the years pass. Agile gives designers freedom to develop since individuals are not bogged down by a specific structure. The development process becomes a lot more adaptable since everything is more responsive to the users' needs, allowing developers to better respond to changes. Since developers are working concurently with the needs of their users, this also allows for feedback and testing to occur simultaneously, making it so the end product can be specifically tailored to meet their needs.
</p>
<p>
    However, being Agile can also have its drawbacks. Since Agile systems don't have a natural start and finish someone needs to be responsible for connecting each individual model together, which makes the development process difficult since no one can accurately identify the time and cost the project will be. This type of freedom can also be dangerous since there's no defined plan - not having any deadlines to meet or any course of action to take can encourage a lack of motivation amongst employees. Being agile is also hugely relient on collaberation, and if a client isn't as invested in the project then it's going to be difficult for developers to integrate an agile method. Since having both members equally invested can be a large time commitment from the client, they may shy away from the idea. Finally, developers must ensure that clients are in it for the long haul. If a designer were to leave mid-project, the effects could be devastating. You can't just have someone come in and pick up where they left off; since a designers talents and skills become the foundation of their model, it is nearly impossible to replicate it.
