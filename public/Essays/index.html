        <h2><u>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</u></h2>

        <p>
            <b>HTML</b> (Hypertext Markup Language) creates a website's structure. HTML requires specific tags in order to opperate. There are different tags that will perform different things, such as dividing something into a class, which helps the code understand how your build works. It can even be used to tag text files to create colors and graphics for web pages. Imagine it as a framework where you're able to construt the basic skeleton of a website through its code.

        <p>
            <b>CSS</b>, or Cascading Stylesheets, let you syle a website. Essentially it lets you make a website look more presentable by providing specifics (where things are laid out, color, typeography, and overall look). It can do things like creating visual effects for your webpage or create simple animations. This website, similar to HTML, is static (which means that it can't be changed after a website is loaded) and all code needs to be inputed beforehand.
        </p>

        <p><b>JavaScript</b> gives the user the opportunity to interact and change their CSS or HTML code while on the page. It allows for interactions to take place on the website, such as pressing a button and having a menu appear as a result or creating keyboard shortcuts for websites. Javascript allows you to make a website interactive and reactive to cut through the static languages of HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript, a website would be unable to respond to user inputs.
        </p>
        <p>All three of these are considered to be languages, but HTML and CSS are different because they are static languages. This means that assests that are put into their code are set before you run your program - they provide a build in and "static" effect on your page or app. CSS provides more of the flair to a website however, as mentioned prior, which is the main component that sets it apart from HTML's framework it provides. JavaScript differs because it is not static, and depends on the interactions it makes with HTML and CSS as well as the user. JavaScript is what makes an app or a website able to alter content. It interacts with CSS and HTML, making it possible for different actions to take place while using a website or app.</p>
