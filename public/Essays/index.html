        <h1>Homework In Class</h1>
        
        <h2><u><b>Q1.</b> Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</u></h2>

        <p>
            <b>HTML</b> (Hypertext Markup Language) creates a website's structure. HTML requires specific tags in order to opperate. There are different tags that will perform different things, such as dividing something into a class, which helps the code understand how your build works. It can even be used to tag text files to create colors and graphics for web pages. Imagine it as a framework where you're able to construt the basic skeleton of a website through its code.
        </p> 

        <p>
            <b>CSS</b>, or Cascading Stylesheets, let you syle a website. Essentially it lets you make a website look more presentable by providing specifics (where things are laid out, color, typeography, and overall look). It can do things like creating visual effects for your webpage or create simple animations. This website, similar to HTML, is static (which means that it can't be changed after a website is loaded) and all code needs to be inputed beforehand.
        </p>

        <p><b>JavaScript</b> gives the user the opportunity to interact and change their CSS or HTML code while on the page. It allows for interactions to take place on the website, such as pressing a button and having a menu appear as a result or creating keyboard shortcuts for websites. Javascript allows you to make a website interactive and reactive to cut through the static languages of HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript, a website would be unable to respond to user inputs.
        </p>
        <p>All three of these are considered to be languages, but HTML and CSS are different because they are static languages. This means that assests that are put into their code are set before you run your program - they provide a build in and "static" effect on your page or app. CSS provides more of the flair to a website however, as mentioned prior, which is the main component that sets it apart from HTML's framework it provides. JavaScript differs because it is not static, and depends on the interactions it makes with HTML and CSS as well as the user. JavaScript is what makes an app or a website able to alter content. It interacts with CSS and HTML, making it possible for different actions to take place while using a website or app.</p>
        
        <h2><u><b>Q2.</b>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</u></h2>

        <p>
            A Single Page Application (or SPA) is an app or website that responds to the user by rewriting its code on the current web page with new data from the web server, as opposed to the browser loading entire new pages. A SPA’s goal is to allow for faster transitions when interacting with the page, and makes it feel more like a native app than a web page (a native app being a program that is meant to be used on a specific operating system or device). All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code can be retrieved by the browser with one page load, or the appropriate resources are loaded and added to the page based on user interaction. This gives an SPA a more dynamic feel since it’s responding to the user directly by offering exactly what is needed for the interaction rather than using unnecessary resources by re-downloading the same elements. SPAs are great for developing dynamic platforms that have a small amount of data and can be a great base for making mobile apps. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A MPA (or Multiple Page Application) has a bit more of a traditional make up. Every page in a MPA sends a request to the serve and updates all the data. However, this is true even if there is a small amount of data being used, thus sacrificing performance. Most MPAs act this way out of necessity because they are more complex sites with multiple pages and include many levels with various links. Since they don’t have any page limitations, they can include as much product info as required. These apps have a faster initial page load and are a little more effective for users that need a visual map of where to go with clear navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where the two apps differ is in what someone plans on doing with them. Single page apps are typically used for developing mobile apps due to their readily made code and their speed. They tend to load quicker and are easier to use for both the user and the developer, especially since their front end and back end contents can be separated. This means that developers don’t need to have a server application running, making interacting with the app easier on both sides. MPAs are typically used when designing a website since they have multiple pages and URLs that must load whenever a user clicks a new button. While this does mean slower loading times than a SPA, a MPA makes up for it with its enhanced security, lower costs, and its Search Engine Optimization (SEO) opportunities. A more advanced SEO leads to more potential hits since there are so many potentials for URLs for the search engine to index, and enhanced security is the result of MPA requests being handled by the server since it is being reloaded every time a button is pressed. Yet MPAs are far more complicated to work with and are much more time ineffective during development. They also can provide complications when interacting with mobile devices and are not optimized as SPAs are in this instance. An easier way to think of the difference between the two: SPAs are more optimized for mobile performance, and MPAs are more optimized for web performance.

        <h3><u><b>Q3.</b>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer, and Back End Developer?</u></h3>
        <p>
        <b>Web designers</b> typically help with graphics and graphic design software, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign) to create the product’s look. A designer’s work is very much creative in nature, bringing to life the product with a certain style. While some web designers may be asked to step into the shoes of a Front End Developer, they are usually just in charge of the creative elements. Putting everything into the right place and making the site appealing to the user comes first, which is accomplished creating “high fidelity diagrams.” These diagrams encapsule the entire look of the page, from typography to color combination to brand design.
            </p>
<p>

<b>A Front-End Developer</b> produces all the code that is used on the front end of the website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) which is to say the code the user can see and interact with directly. This can also be referred to as the “client-side” of development, where Front End Developers oversee everything the users see in their browser or app. While this seems to be similar to a web designer in so far that Front End Designers deal with a product’s look, the difference here is FEDs use code to create a certain style while designers utilize creative apps or programs. They are responsible for making the products responsive and that the content is “fixed,” which means that large pieces of new data aren’t constantly being uploaded. They want to make a site that is easy to navigate for client and user alike through interactive features and written code.
</p>
<p>

<b>A Back End Developer</b> works on the serve side of an app or website and oversees everything communicated between the database and the browser. This means that Back End Developers are responsible for the code that links database information and the browser. They are responsible for server work, ensuring that their code allows the app or site to run smoothly and effectively. Back End programing languages differ from Front End, and include Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and .Net. These individuals are most concerned about a site’s responsiveness and speed, and are not as concerned about the overall style of the site. They create dynamic sites, which are different than the static sites of Front End Developers, which are products that store database information. Where a static site would not constantly upload new info, dynamic sites are constantly changing and updating such as Google Maps or Twitter.
</p>

<h3><u><b>Q4.</b> What is the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths? </u></h3>

<p>
    To understand the difference between site relative, document relative, and absolute paths, we need to understand what the difference between absolute and relative paths are. Paths are directions of sorts that lead to to specific places in a URL or directory, with relative and absolute paths leading you to different locations. Relative paths are URLs that contain only a portion of a full path, and its location is based on the URLs relation to the directory its leading to. This is typically used for convienience sake, since they require less typing and fewer characters. Relative paths also need to be combined with other paths in order to access a file so that a location can be specified. <b> Document Relative </b> paths refer to where documents exist within the directories, and are useful for shared indexes on networks when a physical drive use different letters to represent different users. To set these up, one can specify the path by omitting the part of the absolute URL that the documents share (for example, if the two share "C://User/MyStuff..." then you can link the tail end of that directory so that the files have a more consistent path to take). The same is true for <b> Site Relative </b> paths, which are linked together using the root of the site. For these, the paths can share the same URL (such as www.mysite.com/server and www.mysite.com/community) but can still be linked together using the root of the URL. These typically start with a forward slash (/). This way your paths are more conscise and take up less characters, which is more convienient for developers.
</p>
<p>
        <b> Absolute Paths </b> usually start with the domain URL and are not relient on combining directory roots. It always containts the root element and the complete directory list so that the file can be located. It contains all of the necessary information to locate the file, making it pretty accurate but a tad inconvienient. This can result in slower page load times since you have not told the server the your linked page is located on the same site, forcing your browser to sift through more information to find the directory. It can also be chellenging when wanting to switch domain names since it is hard coded into the site through an absolute path. However, it is much more precise than relative paths because it provides the exact location of a file in your code rather than a shortcut to said file.

<h3><u><b>Final Project Description</b></u></h3>
    <p>
    For my final protect I wanted to do a simple redesign of the bungie.net homepage. Bungie is a video game company in charge of making games such as Halo and Destiny, known as “first person shooter” games. This video game company is widely popular, fostering a community of players that are involved in the growth of the site through forums and through the game itself. After browsing their site I felt as if there were a lot of components we have replicated in class, and that the pages themselves didn’t seem too involved. Features include a store page and a log in page but also include other features we have not touched on in our example website (such as the news or community sections).
    </p>
<p>
I chose this website because of the path I’m traveling in my UCLA extension coursework. I’m enrolled in the UX branch of the program and want to take that knowledge into the field of User Experience Research, working with game developers specifically. Bungie.net is a site very near and dear to me since I used to spend a lot of time on it when I was younger and have had the opportunity to watch it blossom into what it is today. While there are a few features that I still need to figure out how to implement I think the site provides a welcoming challenge, an opportunity to scale it back to include easy to navigate essentials tabs similar to our in class example. I’m unsure if I’m getting in too far over my head and have some back up ideas should this no work out, but I see this opportunity as relevant experience in the industry I want to work in.

<h2><u><b>Q5.</b> What does it mean for a company to be Agile? What is the purpose of using Agile, and what are its pros and cons?</u></h2>
<p>An <b> Agile </b> company is a company that is able to quilckly adapt to market changes. These companies need to have several qualities in order to be agile; they must be fast moving and flexible, respond rapidly to unexpected obstacles, be a leader for change, be in touch with customers, and continue to have competitive advantage over others. Being agile promotes adaptive planning and the continuous delivery of software demanded by the market. There are a few branches that come together under the term Agile (such as Kanban, Scrum, and Extreme Programing), which allow a company to respond to changing requirements and customer unpredictability. Despite having multiple methods, Agile holds four values that each method agrees on: Individuals and Interactions, working softwar, customer collaboration, and the ability to respond to change. These all coincide with the five steps projects in agile go through while they're being developed: Define, design, build, test, and release.
</p>
<p>
    Agile allows companies to produce incremental, iterative, and demonstrable software solutions. It's an essential piece of development in order to stay on top of market demands, and has been used more and more frequently as the years pass. Agile gives designers freedom to develop since individuals are not bogged down by a specific structure. The development process becomes a lot more adaptable since everything is more responsive to the users' needs, allowing developers to better respond to changes. Since developers are working concurently with the needs of their users, this also allows for feedback and testing to occur simultaneously, making it so the end product can be specifically tailored to meet their needs.
</p>
<p>
    However, being Agile can also have its drawbacks. Since Agile systems don't have a natural start and finish someone needs to be responsible for connecting each individual model together, which makes the development process difficult since no one can accurately identify the time and cost the project will be. This type of freedom can also be dangerous since there's no defined plan - not having any deadlines to meet or any course of action to take can encourage a lack of motivation amongst employees. Being agile is also hugely relient on collaberation, and if a client isn't as invested in the project then it's going to be difficult for developers to integrate an agile method. Since having both members equally invested can be a large time commitment from the client, they may shy away from the idea. Finally, developers must ensure that clients are in it for the long haul. If a designer were to leave mid-project, the effects could be devastating. You can't just have someone come in and pick up where they left off; since a designers talents and skills become the foundation of their model, it is nearly impossible to replicate it.

<h3><u><b>Q6.</b> Define the following roles:Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</u> </h3>

<p>
A <b> Project Manager </b> is the captain of the development team, ensuring that everyone sticks to the plan and recorrects them if they're steering off course. They help manage client expectations, track hours spent working vs available budget, and organize everyone's priorities when it comes to project demands and tasks. However, one of the most important things a project manager does is how they effectively oversee the team, reducing the time they spend on non-project related tasks. This helps the project move forward at an efficient pace, making it cost effective and not needlessly time consuming.
</p>
<p>
A <b> Business Analyst </b> is responsible for bridging the gap between IT and the business. In order to do this it uses data analytics to observe processes, determine what the projects requirements are and deliver data driven reports to executives. These members are in charge of figuring out (through emperical evidence) how their data can increase efficiency and add value to the project. One of the most important roles is to identify and prioritize the technical and functional requirements of a business so that they can be addressed and managed in the most efficient way possible. Data analysists are fueled by research, and use it to drive a company forward.
</p>
<p>
A <b> Scrum Master </b> is in charge of ensuring a thorough scrum process is apparent throughout the process. Scrum is an agile framework of developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, but emphasizes software development. A team breaks their work into goals with specific time windows for each, and Scrum helps teams maintain that focus so that their work can be efficient and manageable. These short goals typically last between two weeks to a month, and the Scrum Master is in charge of seeing those goals through. They facilitate the entire process, making sure to hold together the Scrum framework for the team.
</p>
<p>
A <b> UX Designer </b> is in charge of the overall design of the product. This is different than graphic design, where a UX designer's job involves making a product useful, usable, and enjoyable for its users. They want a product that appeals to users not necessarily in a visual sense, but in a usability sense; they can accomplish this by doing product research, creating personas and scenarios, and designing prototypes for how the product will work. They want to ensure that a product is intuitive for a user and reacts accordingly.
</p>
<p>
A <b> Web Developer/Engineer </b>  creates and maintains websites, testing features such as interface layouts, functions, and navigation for usability. They program the code that tells a website what to do, building from the bottom up so that by the end product a user has no problem navigating the site. A web developers duties can be divided into three parts: Code that executes in a web browser, code that executes on a web server (server side scripting), and database technology. In essence, web devs are there to ensure that the website can function.
</p>
<p>
A <b> Quality Assurance Tester </b> runs various tests to check the software of new products for defects or issues. They are in charge of finding any bugs and reporting them through firsthand experience with the product. By recording the defects of the product they can share their findings with the rest of the team to insure that the issues are fixed, a crucial step in the design process.
</p>
<p>
A <b> DevOp </b>  works with software developers, system operators, and admins to oversee and facilitate code releases or developments on a regular basis. They are IT professionals who's jobs include project management (in regards to IT), designing and improving the IT infastructure, performance testing/benchmarking, automation (which is building useful software plugins that will lighten the software team's load), optimizing release cycles, and poroviding feedback to minimize errors. The DevOp is meant to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations, allowing for a more streamlined product. They seek to release updates as swiftly as possible, ensuring that there's is always improvement being done on the product.
</p>
<u><b>Q5.</b> What's the difference between JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG files?
    <p>
    There are a few different kinds of image files, and there can be confusion about when to use which one in certain instances. These image file formats are JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG.
    </p>
    <p>
<b> JPG </b> images are known as Joint Photographic Experts Group. These files are best used for photographs, and are the best image files to use if you’re trying to upload a photo onto your page. Usually, photos contain a lot of data and can be difficult to upload, but jpgs take all that data and compress it into a smaller file size without ruining the image quality. However, something to know about saving and resaving jpg files is that the image quality will degrade the more and more you do so.
</p>
<p>
<b> PNG </b> images stand for Portable Networks Graphics and is perfect for web graphics such as logos or illustrations. PNGs help retain the maximum image quality, which makes sure your logo is looking its best. PNGs are larger files sizes because when you save them they don’t deteriorate in the same way JPGs do. This causes for a larger file size and can make your website take longer to load. It allows you to keep the quality of your graphic though, so it can be useful if you want something looking crisp and clean. PNG files also support transparent backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
<b> GIF</b> images stand for Graphics Interchange Format and is best known for supporting animations. These image files have an even larger file size than PNGs and bogging down your website with them can cause extremely long load times. Yet these don’t provide a static image like the other files; instead, they provide a short video clip or animation which would be good if you wanted to show the process of something. They are only encouraged for animations since the files sizes are so large and they have weak transparency support.
</p>
<p>
<b> SVG </b> images, or Scalable Vector Graphics, are vector based files. This means that they can be scaled to any size without ruining the original image quality, unlike the previously mentioned files. The major difference with SVG files is that these files are actually a code which define its shapes, colors, and size, which explains how it retains its high quality. Instead of the static image being stretched out when it’s enlarged, the code of a SVG file is changed. Since these files depend on code it does make it more difficult to upload to a website since you would have to copy the files code into a code block instead of just copying the file. SVGs also require a special program to create, one that is known as a vector based program (like Illustrator or Sketch).  These images are ideal for logos or icons since they will look sharper than any of its file competitors, and since they are significantly smaller they won’t slow down your website at all. It’s critical to understand how each files will aid your website to make sure that one can create a clean and efficient website.
</p>

<u> <b> Q6. </b> What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production? </u>

<p>
A <b> testing environment </b> is a setup for testing teams to perform test cases utilizing different hardware and software. These environments are configured as needed based on individual and company needs, but usually include aspects such as networks, test data, database servers, client operating systems, and documentation such as reference documents/configuration guides/installation guides. Creating the correct space with specific means allows for efficient testing so that a company can create the best product they can, as long as they can manage their environment well. Monitoring environments, updating/deleting outdated environments, and investigating any issues that arise will ensure that there is a solid environment for testing.
</p>
<p>
<b> Local Testing </b> refers to the immediate testing of a product or app, and refers to the time in the process where an app is being developed at a developer's desk/workstation. It's the infancy of the testing process, and acts as the "blueprint" for how testing should be performed. It may be refered to as the "sandbox," where developers perform anything and everything in otder to see what works and what doesn't.
</p>
<p> 
<b> Dev Testing </b> is when developers attempt to fix or address issues that arrived in local testing. These are when changes really begin to happen since devs address the changelog that was created during the local testing process. Developers begin to record their test data so that they can share it with each other and tackle each issue as it arrises, working off the blueprint provided for them from the previous testing stage.
</p>
<p>
<b>  QA Testing </b>, or quality assurance testing, is a process that ensures a company delivers the best quality product possible. This is done on the backs of QA Testers, who aim to deliver consistent results through a series of testing procedures and benchmarks. It revolves around implimenting standards and meeting requirements, and actually doesn't involve the actual testing of products. Instead it focuses on creating procedures to ensure the best possible outcome. These procedures focus greatly on the process, and focuses on the identification of errors, bugs, and defects in the software. QA Testing seeks to create a more seamless development, design, distribution, and delivery of a product.
</p>
<p>
<b> Production Testing </b> allows for a DevOps team to prepare for possible bugs once an app or product has been released. Since it is common for bugs to end up i production, it is useful for a team to be prepared to handle these bugs so they can work to being resolved quicker through continuous monitoring. Production testing can be important for analyzing user experience and can help devs understand how a recently updated feature is received by their target audience. Two methods of production testing can occur: A/B testing and Continuous Monitoring. A/B testing means that two versions of a website or app or feature are released to see if users prefer one over the other. This way devs can note the changes that need to be made by seeing if certain features in one product are more effective than the other. Continuous monitoring works differently, where devs continue to keep track of a production environment after software deployment so that they can identify issues that could only occur during production. Monitoring the time it takes for a web server to process requests for example will give real world data about the issues users face while working with the app/site/product.
